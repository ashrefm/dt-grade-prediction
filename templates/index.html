	<p>Welcome to DT-Grade Prediction!</p>
	<p>The goal of this application is to take a problem description,
		a question, a studentâ€™s response and determine whether the response
		is correct, correct-but-incomplete, contradictory or incorrect.</br>
		You will not need to set reference answers. The application has them
		in memory since it works only in the scope of previously asked questions.</p>
