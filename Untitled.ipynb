What forces are acting on the ball when it is moving upward and it is midway between the player's hand and the ground? Describe the motion of the ball at that moment.  When the ball is moving upward, a downward force caused by gravity is acting on the ball. There is also a normal force, otherwise known as a ground reaction force, acting upward on the ball. While the ball is midway between the player's hand and the ground, the ball is moving upward. This is happened because the normal force is GREATER than the gravitational force acting on the ball.   \n",
